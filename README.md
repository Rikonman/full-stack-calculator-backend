# full-stack-calculator-backend

To run the backend, open it in an IDE and run it. I used the Amazon Coretto 17 SDK if it gives you trouble building. Make sure you are able to run a server on port 8080. So long as you can use port 8080 and it builds, it should work fine. 

Run this before you run the front end.
